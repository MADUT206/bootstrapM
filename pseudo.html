    <h1>South Sudan</h1>
    <p><b>South Sudan</b> (/suːˈdɑːn, -ˈdæn/;[17][18] Dinka: Paguot Thudän), officially the Republic of South Sudan[19]
        <br> (Dinka:
        Paankɔc Cuëny Thudän), is a landlocked country in East Africa.[20][21][22] It is bordered by Ethiopia, Sudan,
        Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Kenya. <br> Its population was estimated
        as
        12,778,250 in 2019. Juba is the capital and largest city.

        It gained independence from Sudan on 9 July 2011, making it the most recent sovereign state or country with
        widespread recognition as of 2022.[23] <br> It includes the vast swamp region of the Sudd, formed by the White
        Nile
        and known locally as the Bahr al Jabal, meaning "Mountain River".[24] <br> Sudan was occupied by Egypt under the
        Muhammad Ali dynasty and was governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until Sudanese independence in 1956.
        Following the First Sudanese Civil War, the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until
        1983. A second Sudanese civil war soon broke out in 1983 and ended in 2005 with the Comprehensive Peace
        Agreement. Later that year, southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was
        formed. <br> South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, following 98.83% support for independence
        in a
        January 2011 referendum.[25][26] It has suffered ethnic violence and endured a civil war characterised by
        rampant human rights abuses, including various ethnic massacres and killings of journalists by various parties
        to the conflict from December 2013 until February 2020, when competing combat leaders Salva Kiir Mayardit and
        Riek Machar struck a unity deal and formed a coalition government,[27] paving the way for refugees to return
        home.[28] <br>
    </p>

    <p> The South Sudanese population is composed mostly of Nilotic peoples, and it is demographically among the
        youngest nations in the world, with roughly half under 18 years old.[29] The majority of inhabitants adhere to
        Christianity or various Indigenous faiths. The country is a member of the United Nations,[30][31] the African
        Union,[32] the East African Community,[33] and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.[34]
